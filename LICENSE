BashfulLogs License v0.0.1 (Absolutely Not a Real Lawyer License)

By using, copying, modifying, or otherwise touching this code (the “Stuff”),
you agree to the following terms, whether you read them or not:

1. Free Non-Commercial Use
   You may use the Stuff for personal, educational, homelab, or “I broke production
   and need a scapegoat” purposes at no cost. If your boss is not paying you
   money to use this, you are fine.

2. Commercial Use Is Dumb and Bad
   If you use the Stuff commercially, that means someone is making money from it.
   If someone is making money from it, that someone must be me.
   You owe me one hundred percent of the profit generated, gross not net.
   I don't want the money, please do not sell this trash. 

3. **No Warranty**
   The Stuff comes with:
   - No warranty
   - No support
   - No promise of security
   - No guarantee that it won’t wipe your logs, your dignity, or your RAID array

   If something breaks, that is a “you problem.” If it works, that was obviously
   intentional and you owe me admiration.

4. **Redistribution**
   You may redistribute modified or unmodified copies of the Stuff as long as:
   - You keep this license attached
   - You do not claim you wrote it
   - You don’t blame me when someone else gets mad at you
   - You claim you wrote it when it breaks

5. **No Liability**
   Under no circumstances am I responsible for:
   - Lost data
   - Lost jobs
   - BAZARR log processing catching your condo on fire
   - Lost relationships
   - floods, firmware corruption, or emotional damage

6. **Commercial Usage Detection**
   If you use this commercially and try to hide it, I reserve the right to
   publicly mock you and pretend I invented Kubernetes.

By continuing past this file, you accept this license and admit that
commercializing a half-baked homelab project is a terrible business plan.
